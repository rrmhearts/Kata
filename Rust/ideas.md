Of course! Here are five step-by-step projects that are perfect for someone with a C background learning Rust. They're designed to build on each other, introducing core Rust concepts in a practical way.

***

### 1. Build a Command-Line To-Do List App üìù

This is a great first project. You'll create a simple command-line tool to add, list, and complete tasks, saving them to a file. It directly maps to the kind of utility you might write in C but introduces you to Rust's unique features.

* **Core Concepts:** `struct`, `enum` (especially `Option` and `Result`), file I/O (`std::fs`), vector manipulation, string handling, error handling, and using an external crate for argument parsing (`clap`).
* **Step-by-Step:**
    1.  **Define your data structure.** Create a `struct Task` with fields like `id`, `description`, and `completed`.
    2.  **Handle command-line arguments.** Use the `clap` crate to define subcommands like `add <DESCRIPTION>`, `list`, and `done <ID>`.
    3.  **Implement the `add` command.** Write a function that takes a description, creates a new `Task`, and appends it to a list of tasks.
    4.  **Implement file persistence.** Write functions to save the list of tasks to a JSON file (using the `serde_json` crate) and to load them back when the program starts. This introduces you to serialization.
    5.  **Implement `list` and `done`.** The `list` command should read the file and print the tasks. The `done` command should find a task by its ID, mark it as completed, and save the list back to the file.
* **C Comparison:** In C, you'd manage memory for your task list manually with `malloc`/`free` and parse `argv` yourself. In Rust, the vector and `String` types handle memory allocation for you, and the `clap` crate makes argument parsing much safer and more declarative.

### 2. Re-implement the `grep` Utility üîç

Recreating a classic command-line tool like `grep` is a fantastic way to leverage your C knowledge. You'll search for patterns in files and standard input, which will teach you a lot about Rust's efficiency and safety in I/O operations.

* **Core Concepts:** Ownership and borrowing, lifetimes, file I/O, standard input/output (stdin/stdout), error handling, and string searching.
* **Step-by-Step:**
    1.  **Parse arguments.** Get the search pattern and the filename(s) from the command-line arguments. If no file is provided, plan to read from stdin.
    2.  **Read a file.** Write a function that takes a filename, opens it, and reads its contents line by line. Use `Result` to handle potential errors like the file not existing.
    3.  **Implement the search logic.** For each line, check if it contains the search pattern. The `.contains()` method on strings is a good starting point.
    4.  **Print matching lines.** If a line matches, print it to the console.
    5.  **Add features.** Extend it to be case-insensitive with a `-i` flag or to print line numbers with a `-n` flag. For a real challenge, use the `regex` crate to support regular expressions.
* **C Comparison:** In C, you'd deal with raw pointers and manual buffer management (`char*`, `fgets`). Rust's `Iterator` pattern for reading lines from a file is safer and often more ergonomic, preventing common buffer overflow errors. The borrow checker will ensure you're handling string slices safely without creating dangling pointers.

### 3. A Simple Key-Value Store üíæ

Create a command-line program that acts like a simple database. It will take commands like `set key value`, `get key`, and `delete key`, persisting the data to a file.

* **Core Concepts:** `HashMap`, file I/O, serialization/deserialization (`serde`), and modular code organization.
* **Step-by-Step:**
    1.  **Design the command structure.** Use a `struct` or `enum` to represent the possible actions (`Set`, `Get`, `Delete`).
    2.  **Use a `HashMap`.** The core of your store will be a `std::collections::HashMap<String, String>` to hold the key-value pairs in memory.
    3.  **Load the database.** When the program starts, it should try to load an existing database file (e.g., `db.json`) into the `HashMap`.
    4.  **Implement the commands.**
        * `set`: Inserts or updates a key-value pair in the `HashMap`.
        * `get`: Retrieves and prints the value for a given key.
        * `delete`: Removes a key-value pair.
    5.  **Persist changes.** After every modification (`set` or `delete`), write the entire `HashMap` back to the file. This ensures data isn't lost. For efficiency, you could explore only writing on program exit.
* **C Comparison:** You would have to implement your own hash map data structure in C or use a third-party library. Rust provides a high-performance `HashMap` in its standard library. Serialization with `serde` is also far simpler and less error-prone than manually writing data structures to a file in C.

### 4. A Multi-Threaded TCP Server üåê

This is a classic project from the official Rust book and a great introduction to Rust's fearless concurrency. You'll build a basic web server that can handle multiple connections simultaneously.

* **Core Concepts:** TCP sockets (`TcpListener`), concurrency (`std::thread`), shared state (`Arc`), and mutexes (`Mutex`).
* **Step-by-Step:**
    1.  **Listen for connections.** Use `TcpListener::bind` to create a server that listens for incoming TCP connections on a specific address (e.g., `127.0.0.1:7878`).
    2.  **Accept connections in a loop.** Loop over the listener's incoming connections.
    3.  **Handle a single connection.** For the first version, handle each connection one by one. Read the incoming HTTP request and write back a simple hardcoded response.
    4.  **Introduce threads.** For each incoming connection, spawn a new thread to handle it. This allows your server to process multiple requests at once.
    5.  **Create a thread pool (optional challenge).** Spawning a thread for every request is inefficient. A more advanced step is to create a fixed-size pool of worker threads that can execute incoming requests from a queue. This introduces channels for communication.
* **C Comparison:** Multi-threading in C with pthreads is powerful but full of pitfalls like data races and deadlocks. Rust's ownership model and type system prevent data races at compile time. Using `Arc<Mutex<T>>` provides a pattern for safely sharing data between threads that is checked by the compiler, which is a massive safety improvement.

### 5. Create a 2D Game with Bevy üëæ

Jump into the Rust ecosystem by building a simple game like Snake or Pong. Using a game engine like **Bevy** is a fun way to learn about structuring larger applications and working with external libraries.



* **Core Concepts:** Using external crates, game loops, entity-component-system (ECS) architecture, handling user input, and managing application state.
* **Step-by-Step:**
    1.  **Set up a Bevy project.** Add `bevy` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file.
    2.  **Create the window.** Write the minimal code to create a window with a black background.
    3.  **Spawn an entity.** In Bevy, everything is an "entity." Create a player entity (a "sprite," which is just a colored square to start). This is called a `Bundle` in Bevy.
    4.  **Handle keyboard input.** Create a "system" (a function that runs every frame) to listen for keyboard events and change the player's velocity.
    5.  **Implement movement.** Create another system that updates the player's position based on its velocity each frame.
    6.  **Add game logic.** Add logic for spawning food, detecting collisions, growing the snake, and handling game over conditions.
* **C Comparison:** Game development in C often requires building many systems from scratch or using complex libraries like SDL. Bevy's ECS architecture encourages a very clean, data-driven design that can be more scalable and easier to reason about than typical object-oriented approaches. The crate ecosystem (`cargo`) makes managing dependencies trivial compared to manual library management in C.
